## This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
#
#name: CI

## Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
## events but only for the master branch
#on:
#  push:
#    branches: [ master ]
#  pull_request:
#    branches: [ master ]
#
## A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
#jobs:
#  build:
#    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#
#    # Job consists of instructions that you want to trigger
#    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
#    steps:
#
#      # Checkout our code
#      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
#
#      # Switching to Flutter dev branch
#      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v1
#        with:
